/* SCALE_FACTOR is a constant for you to experiment with:
 * if you choose a very large SCALE_FACTOR, your threads
 * might spend a long time sleeping. If you choose it to be
 * too small, your threads will not sleep at all. Note
 * that in the producer and consumer functions, the sleep
 * time is computed as the INTEGER DIVISION below:
 *
 *  usleep(SCALE_FACTOR * rand_r(&seed) / RAND_MAX)
 *
 *  where RAND_MAX is the largest random number returned
 *  by rand_r. There are potential problems here in this computation,
 *  for example, it is possible that the value computed will be out 
 *  of range or will become zero.
 *
 *  Please make sure you think through this issue and revise
 *  the code so that a correct and meaningful value can be
 *  generated for the desired effect.
