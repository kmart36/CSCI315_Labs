(1.1) I do not observe any problems. Some philosophers are eating at the same time, but they are always philosophers whose
chopsticks are not shared. Philosophers who are next to each other do not eat at the same time and when one philosopher is
done eating, the philosopher next to him usually immediately starts eating.

(1.2) Mutual exclusion is happening because only one philosopher can use a chopstick at a time. If a philosopher already has
one chopstick, he has to wait for another one if the other chopstick is being used, which is resource holding. Nothing is
forcing the philosopher to drop the chopstick, and the circular wait can occur if all of the chopsticks are being held and
each philosopher only has one chopstick (ex. They all go for the left chopstick first).

(2.1) I had the philosophers wait between picking up chopsticks to give time for all the philosophers to pick up one,
therefore making it so no philosophers could have 2 and start eating.
