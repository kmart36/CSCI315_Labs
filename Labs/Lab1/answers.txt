(1.2) When the child is created, everything is copied from the parent into the memory of the child. Therefore, there exists a num variable in
both the memory of the child and of the parent. 

(2.1) pid, j, and y are local variables stored in the stack. i and x are global variables stored in the data segment.

(2.2) Both the data and stack segments are copied from the parent to the child process. Changes made in the child are not seen by the parent.
This confirms that the parent and child have separate memory segments.

(2.4) Yes, if one process closes the file the other can still access it. If a child reads from an "inherited" file, it will not affect what the
parent reads.
