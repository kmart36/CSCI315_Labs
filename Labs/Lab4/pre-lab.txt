Problem 1

All three calls open a pathway for bytes to be read and written. Socket
requires a domain, type, and protocol which all specify the type of socket
that is being created while pipe just requires an array for the read and
write ends to be declared. Open needs a pathname for a file and keeps it open
for anything to read from until it is closed.


Problem 2

1. The address of the program is passed as an argument of the socket
function.
2. The bind call binds a local protocol address to the created socket.
3. The connect call is used by the TCP client to connect to a TCP server.
4. The listen call converts an unconnected socket into a passive socket which
listens for incoming connection requests.
5. The accept call is used to retrieve a connection request and convert it
into a request.
6. Echod and echoreq will need to use read and write in order to send bytes to each
other.
