Problem 3
1. Because when both echoreq and echod are running, they are processes. The communication is between the two programs while
they are running, aka while they are processes.
2. Socket functionality is provided by the kernel. The kernel implements up to the transport layer. Networking is not
necessary for the kernel, but ever since the Internet was invented and came into use, it is unlikely that a Linux system
would not eventually need to connect to another system.
3. You should use pipes when you are working on just one system. If you are connecting processes across systems, you should
use sockets.
4. gethostbyname(3) will take the host name that we give to the function call and convert it to a host name that can be
used by struct sockaddr sad structure. It is necessary to convert the host name to an IPv4 address for the connection to the
socket.
5. getaddrinfo will eventually replace gethostbyname. This returns an addrinfo struct which contains an Internet address that can be specified using bind
or connect.
