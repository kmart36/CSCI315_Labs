1. Variables stored in the heap are copied from parent to child.
2. The child and parent can use the same pipe because each reader and writer is closed before a new one is opened, maintaining the one reader
and one writer balance.
3. Both Linux files and pipes use the same methods (open, close, read, write) to interact with. Pipes are written to and read from specific
spots in the pipe array whereas files are just written to and read from the same place. Pipes can also only be written to and read from one
process at a time while files can be written to and read from multiple processes.
